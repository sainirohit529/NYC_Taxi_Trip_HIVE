The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City. 
The detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates. 

The records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations (location coordinates of the starting and ending points), trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, driver-reported passenger counts etc. 
The data used was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). 

The dataset was created by aggregating the aforementioned records. It provides precise location coordinates for where the trip started and ended, timestamps for when the trip started and ended, plus a few other variables including fare amount, payment method, and distance travelled.

I have ONLY consider the data of yellow taxis for November and December of the year 2017.
